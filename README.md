# Lab 4: Exploring HTML Elements

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration of HTML elements, demonstrating the usage of nearly all standard HTML5 tags in a single "kitchen sink" style document. The purpose is to understand HTML syntax, validation, and the wide variety of elements available for web development.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (internal stylesheet)
- WNu Html Validator

## Next Steps
- Complete validation and capture success screenshot
- Publish to GitHub Pages
- Consider adding external CSS file for improved styling
- Add more interactive JavaScript demonstrations

### Types of Issues

- The `<marquee>` element is deprecated but included for demonstration of deprecated HTML features
    - was switched to `<p>`
- Some external resource paths reference `/shared-assets/` which won't load without a proper asset directory
- The `<dialog>` element has limited browser support in older versions
